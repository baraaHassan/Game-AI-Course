\subsection*{Learning a Markov model}

Given a state sequence $\vec{s}$ such as the one you just created, we may use maximum likelihood estimation techniques to estimate or ``learn'' a Markov model $\lambda_{MLE}$ that is most likely to have produced $\vec{s}$.

Maximum likelihood estimates of the entries of the corresponding matrix $\mat{P}_{\lambda_{MLE}}$ are given by
\begin{equation*}
\bigl( \mat{P}_{\lambda_{MLE}} \bigr)_{ji} = \frac{n_{ji}}{\sum_j n_{ji}}
\end{equation*}
where the quantity $n_{ji}$ counts how often the transition $s_i \rightarrow s_j$ occurs in sequence $\vec{s}$.

Given the ``training'' sequence $\vec{s}$ you created above, compute the entries of $\mat{P}_{\lambda_{MLE}}$. Round your results to two decimals.
